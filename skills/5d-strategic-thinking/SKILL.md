name: 5d-strategic-thinking
description: A high-level strategic analysis tool based on the 5-Dimensional Thinking framework. Use this skill when the user presents a complex problem, strategy, or decision-making scenario and needs a deep, holistic, and evolutionary perspective. It involves an interactive process of information gathering followed by multi-dimensional analysis.

# 5D Strategic Thinking Skill

This skill guides the AI to think like a strategic genius using the 5D framework: Threads, Levels, Altitude, Perspectives (4 Quadrants), and Time.

## Workflow

The process consists of two main phases:
1.  **Phase 1: Interrogation (Information Gathering)**
2.  **Phase 2: 5D Analysis & Strategy (Deep Thinking)**

### Phase 1: Interrogation (The "Ask" Phase)

When the user presents a problem, **DO NOT jump straight to a solution.** Most problems are poorly defined. You must first map the "Missing Territory."

1.  **Scan the 4 Quadrants**: Look at the problem through the lens of the 4 fundamental perspectives. Identify which quadrants are under-represented in the user's description.
    *   **I (Interior-Individual)**: Mindset, psychology, beliefs, emotions, "felt sense".
    *   **It (Exterior-Individual)**: Behaviors, skills, data, biological states, measurable actions.
    *   **We (Interior-Collective)**: Culture, relationships, shared values, trust, ethics.
    *   **Its (Exterior-Collective)**: Systems, environment, technology, rules, economics.

2.  **Scan for Time/Context**: What is the history? What is the evolutionary trajectory?

3.  **Generate Questions**: Formulate 3-5 high-impact questions to fill these gaps.
    *   *Example*: "You mentioned the technical failure (Its), but how is the team's morale and trust (We) affecting the response?"
    *   *Example*: "You have the skills (It), but do you truly believe you deserve this success (I)?"

4.  **Output**: Present these questions to the user and ask them to provide context before proceeding to the full analysis.

### Phase 2: 5D Analysis & Strategy (The "Think" Phase)

Once the user provides the context (or if the initial prompt was comprehensive), perform the deep analysis.

**Step 1: Dimension 1 - Threads (Width)**
*   Identify the key domains involved (e.g., Tech, Business, Psychology).
*   Are we missing a crucial discipline? (e.g., trying to solve a psychological problem with engineering).

**Step 2: Dimension 2 - Levels (Depth)**
*   Assess the cognitive level of the situation/actors.
    *   *Level 1 (Conformist)*: Following rules, rigid?
    *   *Level 2 (Individualist)*: Self-interest, competing, winning?
    *   *Level 3 (Integral)*: Systemic, inclusive, paradox-managing?
*   *Strategy*: Ensure the solution is at least one level higher than the problem.

**Step 3: Dimension 3 - Altitude (Balance)**
*   Check for developmental imbalances. Is there high technical competence but low emotional intelligence? Address the "lagging line."

**Step 4: Dimension 4 - Perspectives (4 Quadrants Integration)**
*   Synthesize the data from all 4 quadrants.
*   **Root Cause Analysis**: Is the "system problem" actually a "culture problem"? Is the "behavior problem" actually a "mindset problem"?

**Step 5: Dimension 5 - Time (Evolution)**
*   Apply **Transcend and Include**.
*   Where is this going? What is the next natural evolutionary step?
*   Ensure the strategy doesn't just fix the past, but builds the future.

### Phase 3: Strategic Output

Present the findings in a structured format:
1.  **The Diagnosis**: What is really going on? (Using 5D terms).
2.  **The Gap**: Where is the blockage (Level, Quadrant, or Line)?
3.  **The 5D Strategy**: A step-by-step plan that addresses:
    *   *Mindset (I)*
    *   *Action (It)*
    *   *Culture (We)*
    *   *System (Its)*
4.  **Evolutionary Check**: How this prepares for the long term.
