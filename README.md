# Gavin's Agent Skills Repository

[🇨🇳 中文说明](README_zh.md)

Welcome to my personal Agent Skills collection. This repository not only stores skill source code accumulated in work and life, but also records various tools, workflows, and specialized knowledge bases I have built for AI Agents. This project follows Anthropic's official Agent Skills standard structure, designed for modularity, scalability, and ease of use.

## 📖 Introduction

Each folder here (located in the `skills/` directory) represents an independent "skill"—whether it's data processing, API integration, or complex workflow automation. These skills are designed to be dynamically loaded and used by AI Agents (such as Claude / Trae or other Agent tools supporting Skills), thereby extending the Agent's capability boundaries.

## 📂 Structure

The repository structure is clear and easy to browse and maintain:

```text
gavin-skills-repo/
├── README.md           # Project Home (English)
├── README_zh.md        # Project Home (Chinese)
├── skills/             # Core directory containing all skills
│   ├── _template/      # Standard template for creating new skills
│   └── 5d-strategic-thinking/   # 5D Strategic Thinking skill, a high-level strategic analysis tool based on the 5-dimensional thinking framework, inspired by Dan Koe's long tweets

## 🛠️ Skill Showcase

| Skill Name | Description | Path |
|---|---|---|
| **5D Strategic Thinking** | A high-level strategic analysis tool based on the 5-dimensional thinking framework, providing deep, comprehensive, and evolutionary perspectives. | [`skills/5d-strategic-thinking`](skills/5d-strategic-thinking/SKILL.md) |
| *Coming Soon* | *More professional skills are under development...* | ... |

## 🚀 How to Use

Each skill is self-contained. To use a skill:

1.  Enter the corresponding skill folder under the `skills/` directory.
2.  Read the `SKILL.md` file to understand the skill's purpose, input requirements, and usage examples.
3.  Load the skill into your Agent context or configuration system.

### Creating New Skills

If you want to add a new skill to this repository:

1.  Copy the `skills/_template` folder and rename it to your skill name (e.g., `skills/my-awesome-skill`).
2.  Edit `SKILL.md` to define metadata (`name`, `description`) and write detailed instruction explanations.
3.  Add any necessary scripts or resource files to the folder.
